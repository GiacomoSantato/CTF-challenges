# CTF-challenges

This is a small collection of all the **CTF challenges** I’ve written over the years. Always crypto, sometimes cursed, always hand-crafted.

It’s not a big folder (yet), and I hope it will grow more in the future.  
But life and work often take time away from writing challenges.

Each challenge folder includes the original prompt, source code, and a author writeup with the intended solution and design notes.

They're archived here not just as technical material, but as little pieces of my journey through cryptography.

Feel free to read, clone, and laugh.
If you're a CTF player or cryptography student, I hope something in here is useful to you ✨
